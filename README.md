# ScreenTracker

This application helps you keep track of your screen usage and activity patterns throughout the day. By showing current session length, recent breaks, and the most-used applications, it provides clear insights into your daily computer habits and encourages healthier work rhythms.

**ScreenTracker** is a lightweight, user-space tool for tracking screen usage and application activity on Linux (X11/KDE). It logs when your screen is on, when your system is idle, and which application is in the foreground. All data is stored locally in a SQLite database.

This project is designed for personal use or auditing your own productivity and does **not transmit any data externally**. Transparency and user control are core principles.

## Features

- Tracks:
  - Screen on/off events
  - Idle periods (with configurable threshold; default: 10 minutes)
  - Foreground application switches
- Logs all events to `~/.local/share/screentracker.db`
- Provides a CLI summary tool (`screenstats`) for:
  - Event counts
  - Total active vs. inactive screen time
  - Active time per application
- Automatically detects X11 display and authentication (`XAUTHORITY`)
- Runs as a **systemd user service** — no root required
- Lightweight and relies only on standard Linux packages (`python3`, `xdotool`, `xprintidle`, `xset`, `sqlite3`)
